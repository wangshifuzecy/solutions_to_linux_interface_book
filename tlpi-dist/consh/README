Example usage:

    $ mkdir demo
    $ cd demo
    $ ../create_lowerfs.sh lower
    $ ../consh_setup.sh -c consh_cgrp lower .
    / #

The networking set-up can then be done from a shell outside the container:

    $ ./consh_nw_setup.sh $(pidof busybox) consh 10.0.0.1/24 10.0.0.2/24

After exiting the container shell, you can clean-up with the following script:

    $ ./consh_cleanup.sh -c consh_cgrp demo

    ('demo' is the directory that was created when setting up the container.)
