The dynload.c file contains the source code of the program shown in
Listing 42-1 on page 865 of "The Linux Programming Interface".

The libdemo.so library that is used for the demonstrations on pages
864 and 865 of TLPI is built from files in the 'demo' subdirectory.
Thus, the demonstration at the foot of page 864 and the top of page 865
should be done using the following commands:

    $ ./dynload demo/libdemo.so.1 x1
Â    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. demo/dynload libdemo.so.1 x1
