This repository will include exercises and answers for each chapter of  *The Linux Programming Interface* by Michael Kerrisk, and it may also contain notes for some important chapters.

The UNIX implementation except Linux may not be considered in the answers. (Question containing other UNIX implementations may not be answered) Additionally, the author's operating system is Ubuntu 22.04, and the answers may lack compatibility for other systems.

The `tlpi_dist` directory is the source code of the book, downloaded from the Distribution versioin of [man7](https://man7.org/tlpi/code/index.html)

More chapters are being updated.
