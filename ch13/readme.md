# 13-1. 
Using the time built-in command of the shell, try timing the operation of the program in Listing 4-1 (copy.c) on your system.  
a) Experiment with different file and buffer sizes. You can set the buffer size using the `â€“DBUF_SIZE=nbytes` option when compiling the program.  
b) Modify the `open()` system call to include the `O_SYNC` flag. How much difference does this make to the speed for various buffer sizes?  
c) Try performing these timing tests on a range of file systems (e.g., ext3, XFS, Btrfs, and JFS). Are the results similar? Are the trends the same when going from small to large buffer sizes?  

## Answer
create file of different size.
```sh
fallocate -l 1K file_1K
fallocate -l 10K file_10K
fallocate -l 100K file_100K
fallocate -l 1M file_1M
fallocate -l 10M file_10M
fallocate -l 10M file_100M
```

create executable files with different buffer size.
```sh
gcc -I ../lib -DBUF_SIZE=1024 -o ./copy_1024 copy.c ../libtlpi.a
gcc -I ../lib -DBUF_SIZE=2048 -o ./copy_2048 copy.c ../libtlpi.a
gcc -I ../lib -DBUF_SIZE=4096 -o ./copy_4096 copy.c ../libtlpi.a
```

copy `copy.c` to `copy_sync.c` and modify the open flag. (add `O_SYNC`)
```sh
gcc -I ../lib -DBUF_SIZE=1024 -o ./copy_sync_1024 copy_sync.c ../libtlpi.a
gcc -I ../lib -DBUF_SIZE=2048 -o ./copy_sync_2048 copy_sync.c ../libtlpi.a
gcc -I ../lib -DBUF_SIZE=4096 -o ./copy_sync_4096 copy_sync.c ../libtlpi.a
```

(a)
see `1_a.sh`, using `date +%s.%N` measure really time (it's not reliable but using `time` is not precise considering the file is small and `time` is accurate only to three decimal places.)

- ext4 performs much better than other three file system when file >= 1MB. 
- XFS performs the worst. (It may be caused by my setting. I don't know.)

# 13-2. 
Time the operation of the `filebuff/write_bytes.c` program (provided in the source code distribution for this book) for various buffer sizes and file systems.  

## Answer
`write_bytes` is getting from `../tlpi-dist/filebuff`.
Usage:
`./write_bytes file num-bytes buf-size`

Timer code see `2_time.sh` (you should check the location of `write_bytes` and modify the `file_system` var), testing on create one 100MB file.

# 13-3. 
What is the effect of the following statements?  
```c
fflush(fp);
fsync(fileno(fp));
```  

## Answer
`fflush(fp);` flushes the output buffer associated with the file stream `fp`. It forces any buffered data to be written to the underlying file descriptor.

`fsync(fileno(fp));` synchronizes the file referred to by the file descriptor obtained from `fileno(fp)`, ensuring all data (including data that still be in the system's cache) is physically written to the disk.

# 13-4. 
Explain why the output of the following code differs depending on whether standard output is redirected to a terminal or to a disk file.  
```c
printf("If I had more time, \n");
write(STDOUT_FILENO, "I would have written you a shorter letter.\n", 43);
```  

## Answer
Standard output to terminal is line-buffered while standard output to a disk file is block-buffered. 

When outputing to the terminal, `printf` will flush the output when it encounter a newline.

When redirecting output to a file, `printf` doesn't flush the output immediately. The buffered data stay in memory until the buffer is full or the the program exits (in this case, after the `write()` call). The `write()` write without any buffering, so it output appears immediately in the file. So in the end, the output file's first line is the string of write's argument, followed by the argument of `printf`.

See `../tlpi_dist/filebuff/mix23_linebuff.c`

result:
```
$ ./mix23_linebuff 
If I had more time, 
I would have written you a shorter letter.
$ ./mix23_linebuff > output
$ cat output 
I would have written you a shorter letter.
If I had more time, 
```

# 13-5. 
The command `tail [ â€“n num ] file` prints the last `num` lines (ten by default) of the named file. Implement this command using I/O system calls (`lseek()`, `read()`, `write()`, and so on). Keep in mind the buffering issues described in this chapter, in order to make the implementation efficient.  

## Answer
see `5_tail.c`
